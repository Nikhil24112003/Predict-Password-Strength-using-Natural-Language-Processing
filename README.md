# Predict-Password-Strength-using-Natural-Language-Processing
Developed an NLP-based model to predict password strength using machine learning. Retrieved and cleaned
data from an SQL database, performed semantic analysis on password characteristics, and applied feature
engineering. Used TF-IDF for text vectorization and trained models for classification. Evaluated perforï¿¾mance and enabled real-time password strength prediction.
